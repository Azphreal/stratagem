## Quick play

Very simple run-down of the rules.

### Drafting

Players draft their units to the battlefield at the start of the game in the 4x10 space in front of them.

### Units

- Units are numbered 1-9, plus special units S, B, and F.
- Lower numbers capture any higher numbered unit, with exceptions below.
- Both units are captured in a draw.
- Any unit can capture the flag (F).
- The marshall (1) can be captured by the spy (S), but only if the spy attacks.
- All units lose to bombs (B), **except the miner (8)**, which is the only unit able to capture bombs.

### Movement

- All units can move one tile adjacent, except for the scout (9), flag (F), and bomb (B).
- Scouts can move any number of places in an unbroken line, like the rook in chess.
- Flags and bombs are immobile.
- The eight tiles in the centre of the map cannot be crossed by any unit.

### Winning

The first player to lose their flag (F) or all their movable units loses.
